        Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence
        through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number of
        useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your
        ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general
        statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with
        your comments). In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and
        objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and the Goblet of
        Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide
        Harry’s future for him , depriving him of freedom and choice. For

        before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’sbr <br />
        life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his
        identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,
        Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and
        Hermione’s letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform
        93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts Express; and by sending a
        Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. <br />
        Yet again, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults
        intercede while attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger,

        trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black” (284). All

        haracters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive Harry toward his
        destiny by attempting to control or to direct his life, while themselves
        controlled and db <br />
