        Hello! Iâ€™m a passionate Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN
        stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I have a
        deep interest in building scalable and efficient web applications and
        enjoy solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code.
        <br />
        With extensive experience working with the MERN stack, I have
        successfully developed both front-end and back-end solutions. On the
        front-end, I use React.js to build dynamic and interactive user
        interfaces. I leverage the power of Node.js and Express.js on the
        back-end to build RESTful APIs and handle server-side logic. MongoDB
        serves as my choice for NoSQL databases, allowing me to work with
        flexible and scalable data models.
