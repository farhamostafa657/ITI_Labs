		Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with your comments).

In Harry’s world fate worksbr <br>
 not only through powers and objects <br>
 such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, a <br>
 nd the Goblet of Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, <br>
 other characters decide Harry’s future for him, depriving him of <br>
  freedom and choice. For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys  <br>
  control Harry’s life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding obr

  f his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,  <br>
  Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and Hermione’s <br>
  letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to  <br>
  miss the Hogwarts Express; and by sending a Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking <br>

   his wrist. Yet again, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede while <br>
    attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger, as Snape observes: “Everyone from the <br>
	 Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from <br>
	 Sirius Black” (284). All these characters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive <br>
	 Harry toward his destiny by attempting to control or to direct his life, while themselves <br>
	  controlled and directed by fate. <br>
